*this unit defines the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required to create Object-Oriented (OO) program. Competence includes applying basic language syntax and layout, applying basic OO principles in writing codes, testing, and debugging codes and documenting activities*

- Apply basic language syntax and layout
	- Basic language syntax rules and best practices are followed 
	- Language data-types, operators and expressions are used in accordance with game-code standards 
	- The appropriate language syntax for sequence, selection and iteration constructs is used and customized to achieve robust efficient code
- Apply basic OO principles in the target language 
	- A class that contains primitive member/instance variables is implemented 
	- A class that contains multiple options for object construction is implemented 
	- Enforce class security using encapsulation 
	- Inheritance is implemented to at least 2 levels of depth 
	- Polymorphism is used at a simple level through inheritance to enable easy code extension
- Debug code
	- An integrated development environment is used, particularly the language debugging facilities 
	- Program debugging techniques are used to detect and resolve errors
- Document activities
	- Guidelines for developing maintainable code adhering to a set of coding standard is followed 
	- Internal documentation standards and tools are followed and used
- Test code
	- Simple tests are developed and conducted to confirm the coding process meets design specification 
	- The tests performed are documented 
	- Corrections are made to the code and the documentation as needed
