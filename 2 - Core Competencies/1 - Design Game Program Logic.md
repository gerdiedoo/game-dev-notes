*defines the knowledge, skills and attitude required to design various game program logic to ensure that there is understanding of user and design requirements*

- Analyze game specifications
	- Design documentation is obtained and the requirements for the game are reviewed and clarified based on enterprise standards.
	- Game technical design is conceptualized based on client requirements.
	- Program scope and limits are identified/clarified based on project requirements.
- Analyze game physics
	- Identify & Solve physics problems/equations based on GDD.
	- Determine maximum and/or minimum values, sketch curves, and determine the range for a given domain based on identified physics problem based on enterprise standards.
	- Convert physics formulas from mathematical notations into syntax based on GDD.
	- Apply differentiation based on GDD.
- Prepare technical game documentation
	- Requirements are transformed to technical design document (TDD) according to enterprise standards.
	- Program structures are illustrated based on game design document
	- Special routines or procedures are identified and documented based on project requirements
	- Resources for coding and testing programs are identified based on project requirements.
- Validate the technical game documentation
	- Technical design document is checked for compliance with enterprise documentation standards
	- Technical design document is checked based on project specifications
	- Past project documentations are reviewed for comparison with the technical design document.
