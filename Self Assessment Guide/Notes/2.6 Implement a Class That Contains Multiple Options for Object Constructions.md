  
To implement a class that contains multiple options for object constructions, you can use the following steps:

1. Create a class with a default constructor. This constructor will be used to create objects of the class without any specific options.
2. Create one or more constructors that take arguments. These constructors will be used to create objects of the class with specific options.
3. In each constructor, initialize the object's attributes with the values of the arguments passed to the constructor.

Here is an example of a class that contains multiple options for object constructions:

```
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;

  // Default constructor.
  public Person() {
    this.name = "";
    this.age = 0;
  }

  // Constructor with name argument.
  public Person(String name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = 0;
  }

  // Constructor with name and age arguments.
  public Person(String name, int age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` class has three constructors. The default constructor is used to create a `Person` object with an empty name and a default age of 0. The second constructor takes a `String` argument for the name of the person. The third constructor takes two arguments, a `String` for the name and an `int` for the age.

To create a `Person` object using the default constructor, you would use the following code:

```
Person person = new Person();
```

To create a `Person` object with a specific name, you would use the following code:

```
Person person = new Person("John Doe");
```

To create a `Person` object with a specific name and age, you would use the following code:

```
Person person = new Person("John Doe", 30);
```
