  
To transform requirements to a technical design document (TDD), you need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the requirements.** The first step is to fully understand the requirements. This means understanding what the system is supposed to do, who the users are, and what their needs are. You can do this by reading the requirements document, interviewing the users, and observing them in action.
2. **Identify the key components.** Once you understand the requirements, you need to identify the key components of the system. These are the parts of the system that will interact with each other to fulfill the requirements.
3. **Define the interfaces.** The next step is to define the interfaces between the key components. This means specifying how the components will communicate with each other.
4. **Describe the algorithms.** You also need to describe the algorithms that will be used by the system. This means specifying how the system will solve the problems that it is designed to solve.
5. **Specify the data structures.** The data structures that will be used by the system also need to be specified. This means defining how the data will be stored and organized.
6. **Document the assumptions and constraints.** It is important to document any assumptions and constraints that have been made in the design. This will help to ensure that the system is built correctly.
7. **Get feedback.** Once you have a draft of the TDD, you should get feedback from the stakeholders. This will help to ensure that the design meets their needs.

Here are some additional tips for transforming requirements to a TDD:

- Use clear and concise language.
- Be as specific as possible.
- Avoid jargon and technical terms.
- Use diagrams and illustrations to help explain the design.
- Keep the TDD up-to-date as the design evolves.

The TDD should be a living document that is updated as the design changes. This will help to ensure that everyone involved in the project is on the same page.

Here are some of the common sections of a TDD:

- Introduction: This section provides an overview of the system and its purpose.
- Requirements: This section lists the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
- Design: This section describes the architecture of the system and how the components will interact with each other.
- Implementation: This section describes how the system will be implemented in code.
- Testing: This section describes how the system will be tested to ensure that it meets the requirements.
- Deployment: This section describes how the system will be deployed and made available to users.

The specific sections of a TDD will vary depending on the project, but these are some of the most common.
