  
To apply basic language syntax and layout, you need to follow the rules of the programming language you are using. These rules define how words, symbols, and punctuation are used to create code.

Here are some general tips for applying basic language syntax and layout:

- Use proper indentation to make your code easy to read and understand.
- Use comments to explain your code and make it easier to maintain.
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and other entities.
- Avoid using abbreviations and jargon.
- Be consistent in your use of capitalization, spacing, and punctuation.

Here are some specific examples of basic language syntax and layout for different programming languages:

- In Python, you should indent each line of code by four spaces.
- In Java, you should use curly braces to enclose blocks of code.
- In C++, you should use semicolons to terminate statements.
- In JavaScript, you should use double quotes to enclose strings.

The best way to learn the basic syntax and layout of a programming language is to read the language's documentation and practice writing code. There are also many online resources available that can help you learn the basics of programming.
