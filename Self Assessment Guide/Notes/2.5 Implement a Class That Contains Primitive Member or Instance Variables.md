To implement a class that contains primitive member or instance variables, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new class file with the name of the class.
2. In the class file, declare the primitive member variables. For example,

```
int id;
String name;
double gpa;
```

3. Optionally, you can declare the access modifier for the member variables. The default access modifier is `private`, which means that the member variables can only be accessed by methods within the class. You can also use the `public` modifier to make the member variables accessible to all classes.
4. Create methods to get and set the values of the member variables. For example,

```
public int getId() {
  return id;
}

public void setId(int id) {
  this.id = id;
}

public String getName() {
  return name;
}

public void setName(String name) {
  this.name = name;
}

public double getGpa() {
  return gpa;
}

public void setGpa(double gpa) {
  this.gpa = gpa;
}
```

5. Create a main method to test the class. For example,

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
  Student student = new Student();
  student.setId(123456);
  student.setName("John Doe");
  student.setGpa(3.8);

  System.out.println("Student ID: " + student.getId());
  System.out.println("Student name: " + student.getName());
  System.out.println("Student GPA: " + student.getGpa());
}
```

This is just a simple example of how to implement a class that contains primitive member or instance variables. You can modify the code to suit your needs.

Here are some additional points to keep in mind when implementing a class with primitive member variables:

- The member variables must be declared within the class definition, outside of any method.
- The member variables can be accessed by methods within the class.
- The member variables can be accessed by objects of the class.
- The member variables can be initialized in the class definition or in the constructor.
- The member variables can be modified by methods within the class or by objects of the class.
