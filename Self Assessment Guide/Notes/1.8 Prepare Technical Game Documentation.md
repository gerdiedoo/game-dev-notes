  
A technical game documentation (TDD) is a document that describes the technical aspects of a game, such as the game engine, programming language, art assets, and gameplay mechanics. It is used by the development team to ensure that everyone is on the same page and to help prevent problems during development.

To prepare a technical game documentation, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define the scope of the document.** What aspects of the game will be covered in the document? This will depend on the size and complexity of the game.
2. **Gather the necessary information.** This includes the game's requirements, design, and technical specifications.
3. **Organize the information into a logical structure.** This will make the document easier to read and understand.
4. **Write the document in a clear and concise style.** Use plain language that is easy to understand.
5. **Use diagrams and illustrations to supplement the text.** This can help to explain complex concepts.
6. **Get feedback from others.** Ask other developers and designers to review the document and provide feedback.

Here are some additional tips for writing a technical game documentation:

- Be as specific as possible. Avoid using vague terms or jargon.
- Use consistent terminology throughout the document.
- Keep the document up-to-date as the game development progresses.
- Use a version control system to track changes to the document.

The following are some of the key sections that should be included in a technical game documentation:

- Introduction: This section should provide an overview of the game, including its genre, target audience, and gameplay mechanics.
- Technical Specifications: This section should define the game's technical requirements, such as the game engine, programming language, art assets, and hardware specifications.
- Gameplay Mechanics: This section should describe the game's gameplay mechanics in detail.
- Artificial Intelligence: This section should describe the game's artificial intelligence, if any.
- Networking: This section should describe how the game will be networked, if applicable.
- Physics: This section should describe how the game's physics will work.
- Audio: This section should describe the game's audio, including the sound effects and music.
- Visuals: This section should describe the game's visuals, including the art style and animation.
- Testing: This section should describe how the game will be tested.
- Deployment: This section should describe how the game will be deployed.

The specific sections that are included in the technical game documentation will vary depending on the game's genre and complexity. However, the above sections are a good starting point for most games.
