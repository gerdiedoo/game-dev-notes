Here are the steps on how to implement an iterative prototyping cycle until a game final prototype is approved:

1. **Define the problem and goals.** What are you trying to achieve with your game? What are the specific problems that you are trying to solve? Once you have a clear understanding of the problem and goals, you can start to develop a prototype.
2. **Create a rough prototype.** The first prototype should be rough and incomplete. This is just to get your ideas down and to see if they are feasible. You can use low-fidelity tools and materials, such as paper, cardboard, and sticky notes.
3. **Test the prototype with users.** The next step is to test the prototype with users. This will help you to identify any problems with the design and to get feedback on what is working and what is not. You can test the prototype with friends, family, colleagues, or potential users.
4. **Analyze feedback and make revisions.** Once you have received feedback, you need to analyze it and make revisions to the prototype. This process may involve iterating several times until you are satisfied with the design.
5. **Repeat steps 2-4 until the prototype is approved.** The iterative prototyping cycle continues until the prototype is approved by all stakeholders. This may involve multiple rounds of testing and revision.

Here are some additional tips for implementing an iterative prototyping cycle:

- **Start with a small prototype.** It is better to start with a small prototype that you can quickly and easily test. This will help you to avoid wasting time and resources on a prototype that is not feasible.
- **Be flexible.** The iterative prototyping cycle is a fluid process. Be prepared to make changes to the prototype as you learn more about the problem and the needs of the users.
- **Get feedback from multiple sources.** It is important to get feedback from a variety of sources, such as users, experts, and stakeholders. This will help you to get a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and the best way to solve it.
- **Document your process.** It is important to document your process so that you can track your progress and make sure that you are not repeating the same mistakes.

Iterative prototyping is a valuable process for developing games. By following these steps, you can create a game that is both fun and engaging for users.
