Here are the steps on how to develop and conduct simple tests to confirm the coding process:

1. **Plan the tests.** This involves identifying the test cases, which are sets of input data and expected results that will be used to test the code. The test cases should be developed based on the software requirements and the coding standards.
2. **Create the test environment.** This involves setting up the hardware and software that will be used to run the tests. The test environment should be as similar as possible to the production environment in which the code will be deployed.
3. **Execute the tests.** This involves running the test cases and verifying that the code produces the expected results. Any defects that are found should be logged and reported to the development team.
4. **Analyze the test results.** This involves reviewing the test results to identify any trends or patterns. This information can be used to improve the test cases or to identify areas of the code that need further testing.
5. **Rework the code as needed.** Once the defects have been identified, the development team should rework the code to fix the defects. The code should then be retested to verify that the defects have been fixed.

Here are some simple tests that you can use to confirm the coding process:

- **Boundary value testing:** This involves testing the code at the boundaries of its input values. For example, you could test a function that calculates the area of a circle by passing in values for the radius that are just below and just above the minimum and maximum values.
- **Equivalence partitioning:** This involves dividing the input values into equivalence classes, such as positive and negative numbers, or even and odd numbers. Each equivalence class should be tested to make sure that the code produces the correct results.
- **Decision table testing:** This involves creating a table that lists all the possible combinations of input values and the corresponding output values. Each combination of input values should be tested to make sure that the code produces the correct output.

These are just a few simple tests that you can use to confirm the coding process. The specific tests that you need to perform will depend on the specific code that you are testing.

Here are some additional tips for developing and conducting simple tests:

- Start with the simplest tests first. This will help you to identify any major defects early on.
- Use a variety of test cases. This will help you to cover all aspects of the code.
- Automate the tests whenever possible. This will save you time and effort in the long run.
- Document the tests. This will help you to track the progress of the testing and to identify any areas that need further testing.
