Here are some general tips for applying differentiation based on the game design document:

- **Consider the target audience.** The game design document should specify the target audience for the game. This information can be used to determine the appropriate level of difficulty for the game. For example, a game designed for young children would likely have a lower difficulty level than a game designed for adults.
- **Identify the different learning styles.** Different players learn in different ways. Some players prefer to learn by doing, while others prefer to learn by reading or watching. The game design document should identify the different learning styles that are likely to be represented among the players. This information can be used to design different ways for players to learn the game.
- **Use variable difficulty settings.** Many games allow players to choose the difficulty level. This is a good way to accommodate players with different skill levels. The game design document should specify the different difficulty levels that are available.
- **Provide multiple paths to completion.** This allows players to choose the path that is most challenging for them. For example, a game might have a main story line and several side quests. Players could choose to focus on the main story line, or they could choose to complete some of the side quests.
- **Use adaptive difficulty.** This is a system that automatically adjusts the difficulty of the game based on the player's performance. This can be a good way to ensure that the game is challenging but not frustrating.

The specific methods used to apply differentiation will depend on the game design document and the specific needs of the players. However, the tips above can provide a good starting point.

Here are some additional examples of how differentiation can be applied in games:

- A racing game could offer different difficulty levels, such as easy, medium, and hard.
- A puzzle game could offer different hints or solutions for players who are stuck.
- A role-playing game could offer different character classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.
- A strategy game could offer different maps or scenarios, each with their own challenges.

By applying differentiation, game designers can create games that are enjoyable and challenging for players of all skill levels.
