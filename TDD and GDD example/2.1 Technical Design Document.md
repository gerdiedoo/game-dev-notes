## Section 2 - Choice of Game Engine

The chosen game engine is Unreal Development Kit (UDK). UDK is a versatile development toolkit that utilizes the Unreal engine, providing users with the tools to edit and manipulate game elements. Some key features of UDK include:

- Animation capabilities
- AI support
- Audio system
- Game environment editing
- Kismet (visual scripting system)
- Physics support with physics assets
- Rendering capabilities
- Unreal scripting capabilities

UDK was selected after evaluating multiple game engines, including Cry Engine, Unity, and Torque. It was found to be the most flexible option. All team members had prior experience with UDK, and it's widely recognized within the industry. UDK's comprehensiveness and support for various plugins make it suitable for integrating objects created using different art tools.
## Section 3 - Schedule

The development schedule for the game is outlined below:
- Each group member contributes to every task
- Tasks have assigned lead group members
- Lead group members oversee and contribute more significantly to their assigned tasks
- Lead group members are selected based on their strengths and prior knowledge

## Section 4 - High-level Diagrams to Illustrate Software Design

### 4.1 Layout Diagrams
- Layout diagrams depict the arrangement of different floors within the game
- Game levels correspond to different floors:
  - Top floor = level one
  - Second floor = level two
  - First floor = level three
  - Ground floor = level four
- Top, second, and first floors share a common layout, though room contents may vary
- Ground floor features a distinct layout, as depicted in Figure 2
