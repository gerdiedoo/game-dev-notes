## Section 2 - Game Background & Game Flow

### 2.1 Background Story

The cafeteria in the MMU JD building has sold some exotic fruit. This exotic fruit is turning anyone that eats it into zombies. These zombies only know survival and that is to eat food, which is any live humans. If a zombie bites a human then this human turns into a zombie too. Due to this zombie infestation, the building is on lock down to stop the zombies from getting out. There is only one way to get out of the building which is through the Chester Street exit, and staff ID cards are needed to get through any doors in the building, including this main exit.

### 2.2 Characters Starting Story

The character (a student) has fallen asleep in a computing lab on the top floor of the central JD building. The computer makes a noise as it goes off (due to the building on lock down), and wakes the character up. The character is unaware of what has happened in the MMU JD building. The player must complete the tutorial in the room before continuing on with the game.
