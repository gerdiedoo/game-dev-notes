*This unit defines the knowledge, skills and attitudes required to undertake game-programming tasks using a programming language. Competence includes development environment preparation, basic language syntax and layout application, game-related principles application, assets integration as well as debugging and testing techniques in support of the programming activity.*

- Analyze TDD 
	- Game Mechanics are obtained by analyzing the GDD and TDD. 
	- Technical Storyboard and its corresponding pseudo code are derived from the GDD and TDD. 
	- Necessary hardware/software is set up to code, compile and run according to development environment requirements. 
	- Source code control is set up according to company requirements. 
- Apply basic language syntax and layout 
	- Basic language syntax rules and best practices are observed based on enterprise standards. 
	- Language data types, operators and expressions are optimized and used in accordance with gamecode standards. 
	- Language syntax for sequence, selection and iteration constructs are used and customized to achieve robust efficient code. 
- Develop working prototype 
	- Game module is identified per iteration in line with enterprise policies. 
	- Game Loop is defined and explained in line with key concept and target platform. 
	- Program code is created and implemented in accordance with specifications for the game module in the technical design document (TDD). 
	- Mathematical concepts and techniques are used in controlling and implementing game systems. 
	- Style and design principles are used to solve common game programming problems. 
	- Data structures and algorithms are used and customized to ensure robust and fast implementation of game systems. 
	- Appropriate design patterns are identified and applied in coming up with initial prototype. 
	- Integrate and review different assets based on the GDD and TDD. 
- Test prototype 
	- Execute the prototype and check workability. 
	- Prototype is evaluated based on GDD. 
	- Prototype iteration is applied based on evaluation results. 
	- Improvements and any lessons learned and possible recommendations are incorporated in prototype and documented. 
	- Iterative prototyping cycle is implemented until game final prototype is approved in accordance with enterprise policies. 
- Refine/Debug system 
	- Game prototype is referred to game quality assurance (QA)/testing techniques for user acceptability testing. 
	- Program errors identified are addressed and fixed in accordance with quality standards. 
	- Overall game design concerns including usability and accessibility issues are addressed based on game quality assurance (QA)/testing techniques. 
	- Game program is optimized based on project requirements.
