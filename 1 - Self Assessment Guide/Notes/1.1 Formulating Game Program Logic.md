[[0.1 - Design Game Program Logic]]
Formulating/designing game program logic is the process of translating the game design into code. It involves breaking down the game into its individual components, such as the player, enemies, levels, and objects, and then defining how each component interacts with the others.

Here are the steps involved in formulating/designing game program logic:

1. **Analyze the game specifications.** This includes understanding the game's goals, objectives, mechanics, and rules.
2. **Obtain, review, and clarify design documentation.** This includes the game's design document, which describes the game's overall structure and features.
3. **Conceptualize game technical design.** This involves creating a high-level overview of the game's program logic, including the data structures and algorithms that will be used.
4. **Analyze game physics.** This involves understanding the physics of the game world, such as how objects interact with each other and the environment.
5. **Identify and solve physics problems/equations based on GDD.** This involves identifying any physics problems that need to be solved in order to make the game realistic or fun.
6. **Apply differentiation based on GDD.** This involves applying the game's design document to the physics equations to create a working model of the game world.
7. **Prepare technical game documentation.** This includes creating a detailed document that describes the game's program logic in technical terms.
8. **Transform requirements to technical design document.** This involves translating the game's requirements into technical specifications that can be implemented in code.
9. **Illustrate program structures.** This involves creating diagrams and flowcharts that show how the different parts of the game program interact with each other.
10. **Identify and document special routines or procedures.** This involves identifying any special routines or procedures that are needed to implement the game's features.
11. **Identify resources for coding and testing of program.** This involves identifying the hardware and software resources that will be needed to code and test the game program.
12. **Prepare concept arts for GUI.** This involves creating concept art for the game's user interface.
13. **Validate technical game documentation.** This involves checking the technical game documentation to make sure it is accurate and complete.
14. **Check technical design document.** This involves checking the technical design document to make sure it is consistent with the game's requirements and specifications.

Once the game program logic has been formulated/designed, it can then be implemented in code. This is a complex process that requires a deep understanding of the game's mechanics and rules. However, by following the steps outlined above, you can create a solid foundation for your game's program logic.

Here are some additional tips for formulating/designing game program logic:

- Start with a simple design and then add complexity as needed.
- Use modular design to make the code easier to maintain and update.
- Use unit testing to ensure that the code is working correctly.
- Use debugging tools to find and fix errors in the code.
- Get feedback from other programmers and game designers.
