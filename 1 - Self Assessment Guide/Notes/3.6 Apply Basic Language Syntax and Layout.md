[[0.3 - Apply Programming Skills for In-Game Application]]
To apply basic language syntax and layout, you need to understand the following:

- **Keywords:** These are reserved words that have a special meaning in the programming language. For example, the keyword `int` in C++ declares an integer variable.
- **Identifiers:** These are names that you give to variables, functions, and other entities in your program. Identifiers must follow certain rules, such as they must start with a letter or an underscore, and they cannot contain spaces.
- **Operators:** These are symbols that are used to perform operations on variables and expressions. For example, the plus sign (+) is the addition operator.
- **Delimiters:** These are symbols that are used to separate different parts of your program. For example, the semicolon (;) is a delimiter that separates statements in C++.
- **Comments:** These are text that is ignored by the compiler. Comments are used to explain your code or to make it more readable.
- **Whitespace:** This is any non-printing character, such as spaces, tabs, and newlines. Whitespace is used to separate different elements of your program and to make it more readable.

In addition to understanding the basic syntax, you also need to follow the layout conventions for the programming language you are using. These conventions are typically defined in the language's documentation. Here are some general layout conventions that are followed by many programming languages:

- Use indentation to indicate the structure of your code.
- Use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and other entities.
- Use comments to explain your code and to make it more readable.
- Use whitespace to separate different elements of your code.

By following the basic syntax and layout conventions for a programming language, you can write code that is easier to read, write, and maintain.

Here are some additional tips for applying basic language syntax and layout:

- Use a consistent style throughout your code. This will make your code more readable and easier to maintain.
- Use online resources to learn more about the syntax and layout conventions for the programming language you are using.
- Get feedback from other programmers on your code. This can help you to identify and correct any errors in your syntax and layout.
