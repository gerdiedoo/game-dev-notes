To implement inheritance to at least two levels of depth in C++, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a base class that defines the common properties and methods of the derived classes.
2. Create derived classes that inherit from the base class.
3. In the derived classes, override or add new properties and methods as needed.

For example, let's say you want to create a hierarchy of classes for animals. The base class could be `Animal`, and the derived classes could be `Dog`, `Cat`, `Bird`, and so on. The `Animal` class would define the common properties and methods of all animals, such as the ability to eat, sleep, and move. The derived classes would override or add new properties and methods as needed, such as the ability to bark for dogs or meow for cats.

Here is an example of how to implement inheritance to two levels of depth in C++:

C++

```
class Animal {
public:
  void eat() {}
  void sleep() {}
  void move() {}
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
  void bark() {}
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
  void meow() {}
};
```

In this example, the `Animal` class is the base class, and the `Dog` and `Cat` classes are derived classes. The `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class and overrides the `bark()` method. The `Cat` class inherits from the `Animal` class and overrides the `meow()` method.

You can create as many levels of inheritance as needed. For example, you could create a class `Mammal` that inherits from the `Animal` class, and then create a class `Dog` that inherits from the `Mammal` class.

When you are implementing inheritance, it is important to consider the access modifiers of the properties and methods in the base class. By default, the access modifiers of the properties and methods in the base class are public. However, you can change the access modifiers to private or protected if needed.

If you change the access modifiers of a property or method in the base class to private, then the derived classes will not be able to access that property or method. If you change the access modifiers of a property or method in the base class to protected, then the derived classes will be able to access that property or method, but only within the derived class.

Inheritance is a powerful tool that can be used to reduce code duplication and improve code readability. By carefully planning your inheritance hierarchy, you can create a more efficient and maintainable code base.
