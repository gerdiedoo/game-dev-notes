Here are some guidelines for developing maintainable code:

- **Use meaningful names.** Your code should be self-documenting, so give your variables, functions, and classes meaningful names that reflect their purpose.
- **Write readable code.** Use clear and concise language, and break up your code into logical chunks. Avoid using complex or confusing syntax.
- **Keep it simple.** Don't overcomplicate your code by trying to do too much at once. Break down complex problems into smaller, simpler ones.
- **Use consistent formatting.** Use a consistent coding style throughout your code. This will make it easier to read and understand.
- **Test your code.** Write unit tests to verify that your code works as expected. This will help you catch bugs early on, before they cause problems.
- **Write modular code.** Break your code down into independent modules that can be easily reused. This will make your code more maintainable and flexible.
- **Document your code.** Write clear and concise documentation that explains what your code does and how to use it. This will help other developers understand and maintain your code.
- **Use version control.** Use a version control system to track changes to your code. This will allow you to revert to previous versions if necessary.
- **Refactor your code regularly.** Refactoring is the process of improving the structure of your code without changing its functionality. This can help you improve the readability, maintainability, and performance of your code.

Following these guidelines will help you write code that is easy to understand, modify, and test. This will make your code more maintainable and reduce the cost of future development.

Here are some additional tips for writing maintainable code:

- Avoid using global variables. Global variables can make your code difficult to understand and maintain, because they can be changed by any part of your code.
- Use functions to encapsulate code. Functions make your code more modular and reusable.
- Use comments to explain your code. Comments should be clear and concise, and they should explain the purpose of the code, not just how it works.
- Use a linter to check your code for style and formatting errors. A linter can help you catch potential problems early on.
- Get feedback from other developers. Ask other developers to review your code and give you feedback. This can help you identify areas where your code can be improved.

By following these guidelines, you can write code that is maintainable and easy to work with. This will save you time and effort in the long run.

Here are some of the benefits of writing maintainable code:

- It is easier to understand and modify.
- It is less likely to have bugs.
- It is easier to test.
- It is easier to debug.
- It is easier to reuse.
- It is easier to maintain.
- It is more cost-effective to develop and maintain.
