## Design Game Program Logic

1. **Formulate/Design Game Program Logic:**
   - This involves creating a high-level plan for how the game will function, including gameplay mechanics, interactions, and overall flow.
2. **Analyze Game Specifications:**
   - Understanding and analyzing the requirements of the game, which include features, mechanics, objectives, and constraints.
   - Mastery involves the ability to extract crucial information from game specifications, identify potential challenges, and suggest improvements or optimizations.

3. **Obtain, Review, and Clarify Design Documentation:**
   - Gathering and comprehending the documentation that outlines the design and mechanics of the game.
   - Mastery involves effective communication skills to interact with designers and stakeholders, ensuring a clear understanding of their vision.

4. **Conceptualize Game Technical Design:**
   - Creating a comprehensive plan that outlines how the game's systems will be implemented and interact with each other.
   - Mastery requires a strong grasp of software architecture principles, as well as the ability to foresee potential technical issues and design solutions.

5. **Analyze Game Physics:**
   - Understanding the physical rules and interactions within the game world, which can include gravity, collision detection, and object behaviors.
   - Mastery involves a solid foundation in physics principles and their application in a virtual environment.

6. **Identify and Solve Physics Problems/Equations Based on GDD:**
   - Using the information provided in the Game Design Document (GDD) to translate gameplay requirements into mathematical equations for physics simulations.
   - Mastery requires proficiency in both physics and mathematics, along with the ability to implement these equations in code.

7. **Apply Differentiation Based on GDD:**
   - Utilizing the GDD to determine different variations and possibilities in gameplay mechanics, adapting the game's behavior accordingly.
   - Mastery involves creative thinking and the ability to implement complex rules based on the GDD's differentiation requirements.

8. **Prepare Technical Game Documentation:**
   - Creating detailed documentation that explains the technical aspects of the game's implementation, including data structures, algorithms, and system interactions.
   - Mastery requires clear technical writing skills and the ability to convey complex concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

9. **Transform Requirements to Technical Design Document:**
   - Translating the high-level requirements and concepts from the GDD into a detailed technical design document.
   - Mastery involves the ability to bridge the gap between creative design and practical implementation, ensuring all aspects are covered.

10. **Illustrate Program Structures:**
    - Creating visual representations (flowcharts, diagrams) of how different parts of the game's codebase will interact.
    - Mastery requires a strong understanding of software architecture and the ability to communicate complex structures visually.

11. **Identify Resources for Coding and Testing of Program:**
    - Determining the tools, libraries, and frameworks needed to implement and test the game's features effectively.
    - Mastery involves staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and tools in the game development field.

12. **Prepare Concept Arts for GUI:**
    - Designing visual representations of the game's user interface (UI) elements based on the GDD.
    - Mastery involves a blend of artistic skills, UI/UX design principles, and the ability to align the visual style with the game's theme.

13. **Validate Technical Game Documentation:**
    - Ensuring that the technical design aligns with the requirements in the GDD and can be feasibly implemented.
    - Mastery requires meticulous attention to detail and a critical eye for spotting inconsistencies or potential issues.

14. **Check Technical Design Document:**
    - Reviewing and verifying the technical design document to confirm that all required technical aspects are covered.
    - Mastery involves the ability to critically assess documentation and provide constructive feedback to improve its quality.
