## Apply Object Oriented Programming Language Skills

1. **Identify Game/Project Coding Standards:**
   - Understanding and adhering to the established coding conventions and guidelines specific to the game or project you're working on.
   - Mastery involves familiarity with the project's coding standards and the ability to consistently apply them for maintainable and coherent codebase.

2. **Apply Basic Language Syntax and Layout:**
   - Utilizing the fundamental syntax rules of the programming language to create readable and properly structured code.
   - Mastery requires a strong understanding of the chosen programming language's syntax, including variables, data types, operators, and control structures.

3. **Use and Customize Appropriate Language Syntax for Sequence, Selection, and Iteration Constructs:**
   - Implementing sequential, conditional (selection), and looping (iteration) logic using the appropriate language constructs.
   - Mastery involves being comfortable with designing and writing complex logic using these foundational programming constructs.

4. **Apply Basic Object-Oriented Principles in the Target Languages:**
   - Grasping the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP), such as classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
   - Mastery requires a deep understanding of how to design and implement solutions using OOP principles effectively.

5. **Implement a Class That Contains Primitive Member/Instance Variables:**
   - Creating a class that holds basic data members (variables) representing the attributes of an object.
   - Mastery involves understanding class design, instance variables, and their interaction within the broader system.

6. **Implement a Class That Contains Multiple Options for Object Constructions:**
   - Designing a class that offers different constructors to create instances with varying initializations.
   - Mastery requires a solid understanding of constructors, overloading, and design patterns that facilitate flexible object creation.

7. **Enforce a Class's Security Using Encapsulation:**
   - Restricting direct access to class members by using access modifiers, and providing controlled access through methods (getters and setters).
   - Mastery involves balancing security with usability and understanding when and how to apply encapsulation effectively.

8. **Implement Inheritance to at Least Two Levels of Depth:**
   - Creating a hierarchy of classes where subclasses inherit attributes and behaviors from parent classes, forming a chain.
   - Mastery requires planning class hierarchies, considering code reusability, and understanding how inheritance impacts code organization.

9. **Use Polymorphism via Inheritance to Enable Easy Code Extension:**
   - Leveraging polymorphism to allow objects of different subclasses to be treated as instances of a common superclass, enabling flexible code extension.
   - Mastery involves understanding virtual functions/methods, interfaces, and designing systems to accommodate change.

10. **Debug Codes:**
    - Identifying and resolving errors (bugs) in your code to ensure its correct functionality.
    - Mastery requires strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and experience in using debugging tools and techniques.

11. **Use Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**
    - Utilizing an integrated development environment that provides tools for coding, debugging, testing, and more.
    - Mastery involves becoming proficient with the specific IDE you're using, exploring its features, and customizing workflows.

12. **Use Program Debugging Techniques to Detect and Resolve Errors:**
    - Applying systematic approaches to identify and fix errors in your code, such as stepping through code, using breakpoints, and inspecting variables.
    - Mastery involves mastering various debugging techniques and strategies to efficiently track down and address issues.

13. **Follow Guidelines for Developing Maintainable Code:**
    - Writing code that is organized, well-documented, and easy to understand and modify in the future.
    - Mastery involves adopting best practices for clean code, modularization, and architecture to ensure long-term maintainability.

14. **Use and Follow Internal Documentation Standards:**
    - Adding comments, documentation, and explanations to your code that aid understanding and collaboration among team members.
    - Mastery involves consistent documentation habits, writing clear comments, and creating documentation that is both comprehensive and concise.

15. **Test Codes:**
    - Developing and executing test cases to verify that your code functions correctly and meets the requirements.
    - Mastery requires a strong understanding of testing methodologies, including unit testing, integration testing, and test-driven development.

16. **Develop and Conduct Simple Tests to Confirm the Coding Process:**
    - Creating and executing tests that cover various scenarios to validate the correctness of your code.
    - Mastery involves designing effective test cases, understanding testing frameworks, and interpreting test results.

17. **Document Activities:**
    - Keeping track of your progress, decisions, and changes during the development process through documentation.
    - Mastery involves maintaining detailed records, notes, and logs to facilitate collaboration, troubleshooting, and future improvements.
