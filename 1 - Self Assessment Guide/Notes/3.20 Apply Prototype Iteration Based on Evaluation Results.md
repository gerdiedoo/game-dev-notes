[[0.3 - Apply Programming Skills for In-Game Application]]
Here are the steps on how to apply prototype iteration based on evaluation results for game development:

1. **Develop a prototype.** This is a basic version of the game that allows you to test the core gameplay mechanics. It doesn't have to be polished or complete, but it should be enough to give you a sense of how the game plays.
2. **Evaluate the prototype.** This can be done by playing the game yourself, getting feedback from friends or family, or conducting usability testing. The goal is to identify any areas that need improvement.
3. **Iterate on the prototype.** Based on the evaluation results, make changes to the prototype to address the identified areas of improvement. This could involve changing the gameplay mechanics, the level design, or the user interface.
4. **Repeat steps 2-3** until you are satisfied with the prototype.

Here are some additional tips for applying prototype iteration in game development:

- Start with a small, focused prototype. This will make it easier to iterate and make changes.
- Be flexible and willing to make changes. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things.
- Get feedback from others early and often. This will help you identify potential problems and make improvements.
- Don't be afraid to scrap your prototype if it's not working. It's better to start over than to waste time on a project that's not going to succeed.

Prototype iteration is an essential part of game development. By following these steps, you can create a game that is fun, engaging, and polished.

Here are some specific examples of how prototype iteration has been used in game development:

- The developers of the game "Portal" created a prototype of the game's portal gun early in the development process. This allowed them to test the gun's mechanics and see how it could be used to create interesting puzzles.
- The developers of the game "Super Mario Bros." created a prototype of the game's levels using simple sprites and backgrounds. This allowed them to test the levels' difficulty and flow before they started creating the final game.
- The developers of the game "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" created a prototype of the game's open-world environment. This allowed them to test the game's physics engine and see how it would handle different types of terrain.

These are just a few examples of how prototype iteration has been used in game development. By iterating on their prototypes, game developers can create games that are more fun, engaging, and polished.
