Here are the steps on how to develop a working prototype for game development:

1. **Identify the core mechanic of your game.** What is the key gameplay element that makes your game unique? Once you know the core mechanic, you can start to prototype it.
2. **Choose the right prototyping tools.** There are many different prototyping tools available, both free and commercial. The right tool for you will depend on the type of game you are making and your own personal preferences.
3. **Start prototyping quickly and cheaply.** The goal of prototyping is to test your ideas and get feedback, so don't worry about making your prototype look or play perfect. Just get something working so you can start testing it.
4. **Iterate on your prototype.** Once you have a working prototype, playtest it with friends, family, or other gamers. Get their feedback and use it to improve your prototype.
5. **Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you are happy with your prototype.** Once you are happy with your prototype, you can start to think about developing the full game.

Here are some additional tips for developing a working prototype for game development:

- **Focus on the essential features.** Don't try to prototype everything in your game all at once. Just focus on the essential features that make your game unique.
- **Be flexible.** Be prepared to change your prototype as you get feedback. The goal of prototyping is to learn and improve, so don't be afraid to make changes.
- **Don't be afraid to fail.** Everyone's prototypes fail at some point. The important thing is to learn from your failures and keep iterating.

Here are some examples of prototyping tools for game development:

- **Unity:** A popular game engine that is easy to learn and use.
- **Unreal Engine:** A powerful game engine that is used to create AAA games.
- **Construct 3:** A drag-and-drop game engine that is perfect for beginners.
- **GDevelop:** A free and open-source game engine that is perfect for indie developers.
- **Scratch:** A free and online game engine that is perfect for kids.
