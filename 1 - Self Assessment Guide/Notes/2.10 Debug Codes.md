Here are the steps on how to debug codes:

1. **Identify the problem.** The first step is to identify the problem. This can be done by looking at the error message, if there is one, or by running the code and observing the output.
2. **Isolate the problem.** Once you have identified the problem, you need to isolate it. This means finding the specific part of the code that is causing the error. You can do this by commenting out parts of the code or by using a debugger.
3. **Reproduce the problem.** Once you have isolated the problem, you need to be able to reproduce it. This means being able to run the code and get the same error every time. This can be helpful in debugging, because it allows you to narrow down the possible causes of the error.
4. **Understand the code.** Once you have reproduced the problem, you need to understand the code. This means reading the code carefully and trying to figure out what is happening. You can also use a debugger to help you understand the code.
5. **Use debugging tools.** There are many debugging tools available, such as debuggers, linters, and unit tests. These tools can be helpful in finding and fixing errors.
6. **Fix the problem.** Once you have found the cause of the error, you need to fix it. This may involve changing the code, adding new code, or removing code.
7. **Test the fix.** Once you have fixed the error, you need to test the code to make sure that the fix works. This means running the code and making sure that the error does not occur.

Debugging can be a challenging task, but it is an essential skill for all programmers. By following these steps, you can debug your code and fix errors more easily.

Here are some additional tips for debugging codes:

- Use clear and concise variable names. This will make it easier to understand the code and identify the source of the error.
- Use comments to explain your code. This can be helpful when debugging, especially if you come back to the code later.
- Use a debugger. A debugger is a tool that allows you to step through your code line by line. This can be helpful in finding the source of the error.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps. This can make the debugging process less daunting.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you're stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from a more experienced programmer.
