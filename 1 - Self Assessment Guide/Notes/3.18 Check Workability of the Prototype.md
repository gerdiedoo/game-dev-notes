To check the workability of a prototype for game development, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the core gameplay mechanics.** What are the essential elements of your game that make it fun and engaging? These are the mechanics that you should focus on prototyping first.
2. **Create a simple prototype that demonstrates these mechanics.** The prototype should be as bare-bones as possible, but it should be enough to let you play the game and test the mechanics.
3. **Playtest the prototype with other people.** Get feedback from other people to see if they understand the mechanics and if they are fun to play.
4. **Iterate on the prototype based on the feedback.** Make changes to the prototype to improve the gameplay mechanics and make the game more fun.
5. **Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you are satisfied with the workability of the prototype.**

Here are some additional tips for checking the workability of a prototype for game development:

- Use a variety of tools and techniques to prototype your game. There are many different ways to prototype a game, so find the methods that work best for you.
- Don't be afraid to experiment. The purpose of prototyping is to test your ideas and see what works. Don't be afraid to make changes and try new things.
- Set realistic expectations. A prototype is not a finished game. It is a tool to help you develop your game concept and test the gameplay mechanics. Don't expect the prototype to be perfect.

By following these steps, you can check the workability of your prototype and make sure that your game is on the right track.

Here are some additional questions to ask yourself when checking the workability of your prototype:

- Are the core gameplay mechanics fun and engaging?
- Is the game easy to understand and play?
- Are there any bugs or glitches that need to be fixed?
- Is the game balanced and challenging?
- Is the game visually appealing?
- Does the game sound good?
- Does the game meet the expectations of your target audience?

By answering these questions, you can get a better sense of whether or not your prototype is ready to be developed into a full game.
