There are many ways to illustrate program structures. Here are some of the most common:

- **Flowcharts:** Flowcharts are a graphical representation of the steps in a program. They can be used to illustrate the overall structure of a program, as well as the relationships between different parts of the program.

- **Pseudocode:** Pseudocode is a simplified version of programming language that is used to describe the logic of a program. It can be used to illustrate the flow of control in a program, as well as the steps that need to be taken to complete a task.

- **UML diagrams:** UML diagrams are a set of graphical notations that can be used to represent different aspects of software systems, including program structures. UML diagrams can be used to illustrate the class structure of a program, as well as the relationships between different classes.

- **Natural language:** Natural language can also be used to illustrate program structures. This can be useful for describing the logic of a program to non-technical audiences.

The best way to illustrate program structures will depend on the specific program and the audience that you are trying to reach.
