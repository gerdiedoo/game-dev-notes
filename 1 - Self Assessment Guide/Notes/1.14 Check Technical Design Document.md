Here are some things to check when reviewing a technical design document (TDD):

- **Does the TDD meet the requirements?** The TDD should clearly state the requirements of the project, both functional and non-functional.
- **Is the design feasible?** The TDD should be technically feasible to implement, given the project's constraints, such as time, budget, and resources.
- **Is the design scalable?** The TDD should be designed to be scalable, so that it can be easily modified or extended as needed.
- **Is the design maintainable?** The TDD should be designed to be easy to maintain, so that changes can be made easily and without affecting other parts of the system.
- **Is the design documented?** The TDD should be well-documented, so that it can be easily understood by developers and other stakeholders.
- **Is the design reviewed by experts?** The TDD should be reviewed by experts to ensure that it is technically sound and meets the project's requirements.

Here are some specific questions to ask when checking a TDD:

- What are the system's components and how do they interact with each other?
- What are the system's data structures and how are they stored?
- What are the system's algorithms and how do they work?
- What are the system's security considerations?
- What are the system's performance requirements?
- What are the system's testing requirements?

The specific questions you ask will depend on the project's specific requirements. However, by asking these general questions, you can get a good overview of the TDD and whether it is sound and meets the project's needs.

Here are some additional tips for checking a TDD:

- Be clear about the purpose of the TDD. What are you trying to achieve by reviewing it?
- Read the TDD carefully and ask questions if anything is unclear.
- Compare the TDD to the project's requirements to make sure they are aligned.
- Identify any potential risks or problems with the TDD and discuss them with the developers.
- Make sure the TDD is well-documented and easy to understand.
- Get feedback from other stakeholders, such as QA engineers and architects.

By following these tips, you can ensure that you are checking the TDD thoroughly and effectively.
