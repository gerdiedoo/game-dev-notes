Internal documentation standards are a set of guidelines that govern the creation and maintenance of documentation within a game development studio. They can help to ensure that documentation is clear, concise, and consistent, which can save time and frustration for developers.

Here are some tips for using and following internal documentation standards:

- **Be familiar with the standards.** Before you start writing any documentation, take some time to familiarize yourself with the standards that have been established. This will help you to ensure that your documentation is compliant.
- **Use a consistent format.** Your documentation should use a consistent format throughout, so that it is easy to read and understand. This includes things like the font, font size, line spacing, and margins.
- **Be clear and concise.** Your documentation should be clear and concise, so that it is easy for developers to understand. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may not be familiar to everyone.
- **Use screenshots and illustrations.** Screenshots and illustrations can be helpful in explaining complex concepts or procedures. They can also make your documentation more visually appealing.
- **Keep your documentation up-to-date.** As your game development project evolves, your documentation should be updated accordingly. This will help to ensure that your documentation is always accurate and relevant.

Here are some of the benefits of using internal documentation standards:

- **Improved communication:** Documentation can help to improve communication between developers, artists, and other members of the game development team. This can lead to fewer errors and a more efficient development process.
- **Reduced costs:** Documentation can help to reduce costs by making it easier to find and reuse information. This can save time and money, especially in large game development projects.
- **Increased productivity:** Documentation can help to increase productivity by making it easier for developers to learn and understand the game's code and assets. This can lead to faster development times and a better final product.
- **Improved quality:** Documentation can help to improve the quality of the game by making it easier to find and fix bugs. It can also help to ensure that the game is consistent and meets the expectations of the players.
